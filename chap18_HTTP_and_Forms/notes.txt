Calling fetch returns a promise that resolves to a Response object holding
information about the serverâ€™s response, such as its status code and its headers.
The headers are wrapped in a Map-like object that treats its keys (the
header names) as case insensitive because header names are not supposed to
be case sensitive. This means headers.get("Content-Type") and headers.get
("content-TYPE") will return the same value.
